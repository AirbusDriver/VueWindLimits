# VueWindLimits

A simple learning project I created to learn VueJS and Typescript. Enter crosswind and tailwind
limitation information and toggle between warnings for takeoff vs landing limitation exceedences.
Eventually I'd like to implement a grid that gives the maximum wind velocity acceptable within a
few descrete direction intervals around the average wind. Suitable for calculating the maximum wind
allowed when the wind is being read out and updating frequently.

The current deployment can be used here https://airbusdriver.github.io/VueWindLimits
